# suduku-solver
This project presents a web-based Sudoku solver utilizing the backtracking algorithm,
implemented with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The solver effectively addresses the challenge
of filling a 9x9 grid to satisfy Sudoku's rules, systematically placing numbers and backtracking
upon conflicts. The intuitive web interface allows users to input puzzles and obtain solutions
instantly, demonstrating the practicality and efficiency of backtracking for constraint
satisfaction problems. This project highlights the potential of web technologies in creating
interactive and user-friendly applications for complex problem-solving.
